Shadow detection and removal on digital images

Based on publicly available scientific papers I implemented two detections and two removal methods which only uses the image itself
to detect and remove shadows with different rates of success.

The methods were implemented based on these papers:<br>
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299509760_Removal_of_Shadows_from_a_Single_Image <br>
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5156272

Run gui.py to start the program with GUI <br>
Run menu.py to start the program without gui, you can uncomment which methods you want to use
