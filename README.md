Shadow detection and removal on digital images

Based on publicly available scientific papers I implemented two detections and two removal methods which only uses the image itself
to detect and remove shadows with different rates of success.

The methods were implemented based on these papers:<br>

First shadow detection and removal method: <br>

Second shadow detection method: <br>
